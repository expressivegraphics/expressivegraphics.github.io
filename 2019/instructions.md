All work must be previously unpublished. Production and Meta papers need not contain original research or results, but must make a substantive contribution to the knowledge in the field. Papers should be 4–10 pages in length (excluding citations). Papers longer than 10 pages must make a very significant contribution. Supplemental video and images may also be submitted. Papers are reviewed double-blind and so must be anonymous when submitted. References to your own work should be made in the third person to maintain anonymity.
Technical paper submission is electronic using the [SRM]({{site.symposium[2019].submission}}) system.

### Paper formatting

Manuscripts must be written in English. They should follow the [Eurographics publication guidelines](https://www.eurographics2019.it/index.php/for-submitters/full-papers/), including a title page with an abstract, keywords, and a bibliography. For formatting, please use the [Eurographics Full Paper layout](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2019/Instruction).

* LaTeX [template](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2019/GetConferenceFile?fileID=8929).
* A Microsoft Word template is not available.  Please format according to the [instructions](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2019/GetConferenceFile?fileID=8931).

The use of LaTeX is encouraged and preferred. However, only PDF files will be accepted for your submission. Please make sure that all fonts are embedded.

### Supplemental material
{: .top1}

Supplemental material such as additional images or videos may be submitted as PDF or as a zipped archive (ZIP files) with a maximum size of 30 MB.

#### Video Formatting

Videos should be a maximum of 5 minutes in length and contain either clearly spoken English audio or subtitles. Please ensure that a commonly available format and codec is used. Suggested video specifications are: MP4 container format, with H.264 video encoding and AAC audio encoding. Videos can be converted into this format using freely available tools, such as [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/). Make sure that the video plays with [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), which is available on most platforms.
